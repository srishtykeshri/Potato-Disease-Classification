# Potato-Disease-Classification

This project uses a CNN-based model to detect Early Blight and Late Blight in potato leaves with 99% accuracy. It leverages the PlantVillage dataset from kaggle and is deployed as a web app using React JS for real-time disease diagnosis. TensorFlow Lite ensures lightweight deployment, while FastAPI handles backend predictions, supporting sustainable farming.
